Hello there! 👋🏻

🚀 I’m a Master’s student student @ the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Department</a>, <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institue (WPI)</a>, 
driven by a passion for crafting software that enables robots to see, sense, and navigate their worlds. 

👩🏻‍💻 My journey is centered around conceptual Robotics with Software ventures, equipping me with a specialized perspective. I'm passionate about theory but recognize the importance of practice for a well-rounded engineering perspective. 
Past experiences have taught me to excel in fast-paced settings, adapt to multiple roles, and collaborate with diverse teams.

🔇 Outside of robotics, I recharge through books on entrepreneurship, spirituality, and philosophy.
