Hey there!

I am a Master's student @ the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Department</a>, <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institue (WPI)</a> I am passionate about developing software solutions that empower robots to sense, perceive, and navigate their environments. 
My "Robotics" interests are particulary focused on leveraging vision for robot perception and navigation. 

I am currently interning at [Celltrio](https://celltrio.com/) as a Robotics Software Engineer where my responsibilites consist of integrating tool transform functionality 
in the kinematics model of a 7-axis SCARA robot to account for tool orientation and position, enhancing precision in end-effector manipulation. 

During the summer of 2024, I interened at the [National Robotics Engineering Center](https://www.nrec.ri.cmu.edu/) where as a Robotics Software Engineer, contributing to development of Autnomy Software for a warehouse Mobile Maniupulaor. 

Prior to pursuing a Master's degree, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering. 
As an undergrad, I have also worked as a Robotics Engineer Intern at [Technodune](https://www.linkedin.com/company/technodune/) where I gained experience in overseeing both hardware and software development in robotics.

That's all about me! 
I'd love to connect for opportunities, discussions, or anything robotics!
