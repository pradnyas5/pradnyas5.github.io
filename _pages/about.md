Hey there!

I am a Master's student @ the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Department</a>, <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institue (WPI)</a>.
I am passionate about developing software solutions that leverage vision to allow the robots to sense, perceive, and navigate their environments. 

I’ve had the opportunity to work on diverse aspects of robotics, from hardware development to software abstraction. 
Currently, I am working at [Celltrio](https://celltrio.com/), and previously, I interned at the [National Robotics Engineering Center](https://www.nrec.ri.cmu.edu/) (Summer '24) and Technodune (Summer '22–'23). 
While the majority of my contributions have been on the software side of robotics—something I enjoy the most—I believe it's important as an engineer to also get hands-on with the hardware when needed. 
These experiences have allowed me to thrive in fast-paced environments, adapting quickly and taking on multiple roles, as well as working in larger teams with diverse backgrounds.

To explore more about my professional experience, visit my `LinkedIn` profile.
Aside from Robotics, I draw inspiration from reading books on life, work, spirituality, and philosophy.

That's all about me! 
I'd love to connect for opportunities, discussions, or anything `robotics`!
