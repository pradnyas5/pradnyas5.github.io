Robotics Enthusiast. 
Learner. Doer. Believer.
Hi there!
I am a Master's student at the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering"> Robotics Engineering Department</a>, <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institute. (WPI)</a>  
I am passionate about developing software solutions that empower robots to sense, perceive, and navigate their environments. 
Before discovering my interest in the software side of robotics, I gained valuable hands-on experience working with robot hardware during my undergrad, 
which has shaped me into a well-rounded Robotics Engineer.
I’m particularly focused on leveraging visual cues for robot perception and navigation and I'm seeking opportunities that emphasizeon these areas.
I’d love to connect with fellow robotics enthusiasts for advice, discussions, or anything robotics!
