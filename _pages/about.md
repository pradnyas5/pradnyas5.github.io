Hey there!

I am a Master's student @ the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Department</a>, <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institue (WPI)</a> I am passionate about developing software solutions that empower robots to sense, perceive, and navigate their environments. 

I'm particulary focused on leveraging vision for robot perception and navigation. I'd love to connect for opportunities, discussions, or anything robotics!
