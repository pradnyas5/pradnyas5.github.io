Hello there! 👋

I’m a Master’s student Master's student @ the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Department</a>, <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institue (WPI)</a>, 
driven by a passion for crafting software that enables robots to see, sense, and navigate their worlds. 
Robotics isn’t just my field—it’s my fascination.

My journey spans across hardware and software, equipping me with a unique, well-rounded perspective. Currently, I’m interning at [Celltrio](https://celltrio.com/), with previous stints at [National Robotics Engineering Center](https://www.nrec.ri.cmu.edu/) (Summer ’24) 
and Technodune (Summer ’22–’23). While my heart lies in software, I also believe that diving into the hardware side is vital for a complete engineering outlook. These experiences have taught me to thrive in fast-paced environments, j
uggle multiple roles, and collaborate with teams from all walks of life.

Curious about my professional journey? Check out my `LinkedIn` for more! Outside of robotics, I recharge through books on life, work, spirituality, and philosophy.
Excited to connect for opportunities, insights, or a good `robotics` chat! 🤖
