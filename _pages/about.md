Hello there! 👋🏻

🚀 I’m Pradnya, a `Robotics Software Engineer` by profession. By day, I write code to make robots do their thing; by night, I reflect on how Robotics can drive meaningful, real-world impact.

🎓 I graduated with a Master's degree in Robotics Enginnering from the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Department</a>, at <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institue (WPI)</a>, in May 2025.
 
👩🏻‍💻 Currently I work as a Software Engineer I, Robotics where my work is centered around conceptual Robotics with Software ventures, equipping me with a specialized perspective. I'm passionate about theory but recognize the importance of practice for a well-rounded engineering perspective. Past experiences have taught me to excel in fast-paced settings, adapt to multiple roles, and collaborate with diverse teams.

🔇 Outside of robotics, I recharge through exploring music, spirituality, and philosophy.
