Hey there!

I am a Master's student @ the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Department</a>, <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institue (WPI)</a> I am passionate about developing software solutions that empower robots to sense, perceive, and navigate their environments. 
My "Robotics" interests are particulary focused on leveraging vision for robot perception and navigation. 

I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on diverse aspects of robotics, from hardware development to software abstraction. Currently, I am working at [Celltrio](https://celltrio.com/), and previously, I interned at 
[National Robotics Engineering Center](https://www.nrec.ri.cmu.edu/) (Summer '24) and Technodune (Summer '22‚Äì'23). While the majority of my contributions have been on the 
software side of robotics‚Äîsomething I enjoy the most‚ÄîI believe it's important as an engineer to also get hands-on with the hardware when needed. This experience has allowed me to thrive in fast-paced environments, 
adapting quickly and taking on multiple roles, as well as working in larger teams with diverse backgrounds.

To explore more about my professional experience, visit my `LinkedIn` profile.

Apart from Robotics, I an avid viewer of anime. `I never give up ‚Äî that's my techie way, believe it!`

That's all about me! 
I'd love to connect for opportunities, discussions, or anything `robotics`!
