Hi there! 
I am Pradnya, a Master's student at the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Department</a>, <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)</a>
I am passionate about developing software solutions that empower robots to sense, perceive, and navigate their environments. 
Before discovering my interest in the software side of robotics, I gained valuable hands-on experience working with robot hardware, which has shaped me into a well-rounded Robotics Engineer.
My interests are centered around leveraging visual cues for robot perception and navigation, and I'm seeking opportunities that primarily focus on these areas.
