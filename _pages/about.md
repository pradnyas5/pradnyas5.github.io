Hello there!

👩🏻‍💻 I’m a Master’s student student @ the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Department</a>, <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institue (WPI)</a>, 
driven by a passion for crafting software that enables robots to see, sense, and navigate their worlds. 

🔇 My journey spans across hardware and software, equipping me with a unique, well-rounded perspective. Currently, I’m interning at [Celltrio](https://celltrio.com/), with previous stints at [National Robotics Engineering Center](https://www.nrec.ri.cmu.edu/) (Summer ’24) 
and Technodune (Summer ’22–’23). While my heart lies in software, I also believe that diving into the hardware side is vital for a complete engineering outlook. These experiences have taught me to thrive in fast-paced environments, juggle multiple roles, and collaborate with teams from all walks of life.

🔭 Curious about my professional journey? Check out my `LinkedIn` for more! Outside of robotics, I recharge through books on life, work, spirituality, and philosophy.
Excited to connect for opportunities, insights, or a good `robotics` chat!
