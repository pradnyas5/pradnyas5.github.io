## Concept

This projects was a part of [RBE 549: Computer Vision](https://rbe549.github.io/spring2024/proj/p2/). It implements 3D reconstruction of a scene using a method known as, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) 
which represents a scene using a fully connected (non-convolutional) deep network. Our team was able to grab the [GOLD SUBMISSION](https://pear.wpi.edu/teaching/rbe549/spring2024studentoutputs.html#p2ph2) for this assignment.
