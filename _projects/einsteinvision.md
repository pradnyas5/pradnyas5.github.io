This projects was a part of [RBE 549: Computer Vision](https://rbe549.github.io/spring2024/proj/p3/). It aims to significantly understand Deep Learning for Computer Vision. 
It required a rigorous approach and offered key takeaways in implmenting complex vision-based models.

The following pipeline was designed for implementation based on research:

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align=center>
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/project2/Temp_Architecture.png" title="Researched Vision Pipeline" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

This implementation uses the existing Kinect Fusion[1] pipeline in OpenCV.
